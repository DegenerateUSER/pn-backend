# More Assessment API Requests - Advanced Examples & Edge Cases

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive examples of assessment-related API requests covering various edge cases, complex scenarios, and unique use cases. All examples show only request formats without responses.

## Important Field Explanations

### Assessment Sets Concept
- **`num_of_sets`**: Total number of question sets in the assessment (e.g., 3 means there are 3 different versions/sets)
- **`set_number`**: Which specific set each question belongs to (1, 2, 3, etc.)

**Example**: If `num_of_sets = 3`, you should have questions with `set_number: 1`, `set_number: 2`, and `set_number: 3`. This allows:
- **Randomization**: Students get different question sets
- **Security**: Prevents cheating by giving different questions to different students
- **Adaptive Testing**: Different difficulty levels for different student groups
- **A/B Testing**: Compare performance across different question variations

**Usage Scenarios**:
- Set 1: Beginner level questions
- Set 2: Intermediate level questions  
- Set 3: Advanced level questions

OR

- Set 1: Version A of questions
- Set 2: Version B of questions (same difficulty, different questions)
- Set 3: Version C of questions (same difficulty, different questions)
